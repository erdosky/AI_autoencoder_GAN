# AI_autoencoder_GAN
Program was written while learning about AI. Shows how generating synthetic data with autoencoder works.
The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a data representation that is as close to the original as possible. 
To achieve this, the autoencoder is trained on input data, and its objective is to minimize the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data.
The dataset used is CIFAR-10, which is directly available for import from the Keras library using the keras.datasets module.
